    "# SLU09 Learning Notebook Part 2 ‚Äì Object-Oriented Programming Basics: Why Use Objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now, we‚Äôve been working with simple variables like `apple_name`, `apple_price`, and `apple_quantity`.  \n",
    "That‚Äôs totally fine when dealing with a single fruit ‚Äî but what happens when your grocery list grows? üçéüçåüçä\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine trying to manage apples, bananas, oranges, and even toilet paper... üòÖ  \n",
    "Suddenly, you're juggling a huge number of variables, and your code becomes messy and hard to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "That‚Äôs when we need a better way to organize our data ‚Äî and that‚Äôs where **objects** come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects help us group **related data** and **behavior** into one organized structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python gives us the power to define our own objects using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classes** (the blueprint)\n",
    "- **Attributes** (the data each object holds)\n",
    "- **Methods** (the actions or behaviors the object can perform)\n",
    "\n",
    "These terms might still sound a bit like fairy tale magic üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, but don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî we‚Äôll break it all down step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this notebook is all about\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we‚Äôll focus on **why** objects are useful.  \n",
    "Why not just stick with functions and dictionaries? What problems do objects solve?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you see how much cleaner and more powerful your code becomes with objects, you‚Äôll be motivated to become a pro!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook (Part 3), we‚Äôll dive into how to create your own objects by learning how to write classes, use attributes, and define methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "We promise ‚Äî by the end of this course, you‚Äôll be dreaming in objects, classes, and methods! üò¥üíª\n",

    "- When you need to **store state** (i.e. keep track of information over time), like a basket keeping track of products.\n",
    "- When you‚Äôre working with **many similar \"things\"** that share the same structure and behavior ‚Äî like fruits, cars, users, or monsters in a game.\n",

    "Yes, you *can* do everything with functions, lists, and dictionaries...  \n",
    "But as your code grows, it gets repetitive, messy, and harder to maintain.\n",
