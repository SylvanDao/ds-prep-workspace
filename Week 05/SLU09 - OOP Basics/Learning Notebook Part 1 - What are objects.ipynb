    "# SLU09 Learning Notebook Part 1‚Äì Object-Oriented Programming Basics: What Are Objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we‚Äôll explore one of the most important concepts in programming: **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. You‚Äôll learn why we use objects, how they help us structure data, and what makes them different from simpler data types like dictionaries or lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an Object?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, **an object is a collection of data and behaviors that belong together** .\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of an object as something that has:\n",
    "- **Attributes** ‚Äì the data that describes it (e.g., a name, a color, a price).\n",
    "- **Methods** ‚Äì the actions it can perform (e.g., calculate a total price, display itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are created from **classes**, which are like blueprints for building specific types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are slowly going to explain this concepts, so please stay with us and trust the process. You got this! \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# A very simple object\n",
    "class Dog:    \n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.name} says woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "my_dog = Dog(\"Luna\") # \n",
    "my_dog.bark()  # Output: Luna says woof!\n",

    "    print(f\"{fruit_dict['name'].capitalize()} is {fruit_dict['price_per_unit']}, weighs {fruit_dict['weight']}g and will expire in {fruit_dict['days_until_expired']} days.\")\n",

    "\n",
    "- Track 200 different fruits.\n",
    "- Add behavior like calculating total price based on weight.\n",
    "- Ensure consistency (e.g., `weight` is always a number).\n",
    "- Reuse this structure in other parts of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "It gets **messy, repetitive**, and **hard** to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue is that all \"fruits\" share certain properties (price, expiry date...), but Python does not know it. We are saying that oranges are **entries in a dictionary**. What we want to say is \"oranges are fruits\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "Wouldn't it be great if Python knew what a **Fruit** is?\n",
    "\n",
    "We could just create a `Fruit` once and then generate new ones like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "apple = Fruit(\"apple\", \"red\", 120, 2.5)\n",
    "banana = Fruit(\"banana\", \"yellow\", 100, 1.8)\n",
