# SLU09 – OOP Basics: Object-Oriented Programming in Python

Welcome to one of the most important milestones in your Python journey: **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**!

So far, you’ve worked with variables, lists, dictionaries, and functions. But real-world software quickly gets complex, and that’s where **objects** come in. They help you write code that’s **organized**, **reusable**, and much easier to maintain.

This SLU will guide you through the **fundamentals of OOP**, showing you how to model real-world "things" using **classes**, **attributes**, and **methods**.

---

##  What you’ll learn in this SLU

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:

- Understand what **objects** are and why they’re useful.
- Create and use **classes** to define custom object types.
- Differentiate between **instances** and **classes**.
- Use the `__init__` method to initialize object state.
- Use `self` to refer to instance attributes and methods.
- Add **methods** to your classes (functions that belong to your objects).
- Grasp the idea of **encapsulation**: grouping related data and behavior in one object.

##  SLU Structure

We’ve broken this SLU into **three smaller Learning Notebooks** to help you take it step-by-step:

###  Learning Notebook Part 1 – What Are Objects?

We start with the basics:
- What is an object?
- How are objects different from variables or dictionaries?
- What’s the connection between **real-world "things"** and programming objects?
- How can we represent a group of fruits in a better way than using dictionaries?

You’ll meet Python objects you already use (like `list` and `str`) and start thinking about how to create your own.

---

###  Learning Notebook Part 2 – Why Use Objects?

In this part, we explore **why objects are so useful**:
- Keeping track of multiple “things” (like a basket of fruits)
- How using objects helps **reduce repetition**
- Why objects are better at organizing data and behavior

This notebook is meant to **motivate** you to learn how to use OOP effectively — you’ll see how it helps manage complexity, especially when you have many related things with similar behavior.

---

###  Learning Notebook Part 3 – Creating Our Own Objects

Here’s where the real magic happens ✨  
You’ll learn how to:
- Create your own **class** definitions
- Use the `__init__` method to define object **attributes**
- Use `self` to refer to the object itself
- Add **methods** to give your objects behavior
- Practice building small custom objects, like `Fruit`, `Person`, `Dog`, and `Human`

By the end, you’ll understand how Python uses classes and how you can create your own powerful and cleanly organized code.

## Exercises

This unit comes with an Exercise Notebook that builds up from easy to hard. Make sure to do the following:

1. **After Part 1**, do the first 1–2 exercises.
2. **After Part 2**, try a few more.
3. **After Part 3**, tackle the final challenges!

💡 **Pro Tip:** Don’t just read — try things out! Use the Learning Notebooks to write your own code. Create weird objects, try breaking things, and play. That’s how you’ll really *get it*.

---

## How long will this take?

Plan for around **6 to 10 hours**. Some parts will be fast and fun, and others will feel tricky and abstract. That’s totally normal!

Take your time. Drink tea. Pause, review, and revisit if needed. Mastering OOP will unlock a whole new level of Python programming for you.

---

## New Concepts Introduced

- `object` – everything in Python is an object, and now you’ll create your own.
- `class` – a blueprint for creating new types of objects.
- `instance` – a specific object created from a class.
- `attribute` – a piece of data attached to an object.
- `method` – a function that belongs to a class.
- `__init__()` – a special method that runs when a new object is created.
- `self` – refers to the current instance inside a class method.

## Final words of encouragement

Object-oriented programming can feel like a big shift. But once it clicks, your code will become cleaner, more powerful, and easier to work with.

Take it slow, play with the examples, and don’t hesitate to ask for help. You’ve got this 💪

**Now let’s go build some amazing objects!**
