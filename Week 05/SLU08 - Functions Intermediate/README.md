# SLU08: Functions – Intermediate Level

By now, you've mastered the basics of writing and using functions.  
In this unit, you'll explore how to use functions in more powerful, flexible, and readable ways.

This SLU is all about making your code more modular, understandable, and easier to debug.

## What You’ll Learn

### Positional and Keyword Arguments

Learn how to define function parameters in a way that gives more control over your inputs. You can:
- Set default values to make functions easier to use.
- Use keyword arguments to make function calls more readable.

### Scopes and Namespaces

Understand where variables exist and how they behave inside and outside functions.  
This knowledge will help prevent bugs and unexpected behavior in your code. 

It is absolutely fundamental to understand scopes as it will save you sooooooooo many debugging sessions in the future.


### Built-in functions

Python already has some integrated functions that, despite being non-editable, are available for us to use! We will go through some of the most used built-in functions.


### Fancy Return Statements

Functions can return multiple values, and what they return can depend on conditions.  
Learn how to write flexible return statements and how to unpack returned values.

### Best Practices for Functions

Good functions are reusable, readable, and well-documented.  
Learn how to:
- Write clear, consistent function definitions.
- Document your functions so others (and future you) can understand them.

When writing a program or a script, how can you document all the functions and code so that they can easily be used and understood by any potential user? This is useful even for yourself, as programmers easily forget all the details of a function after some time has passed.
