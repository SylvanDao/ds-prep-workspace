# Welcome to SLU10 - OOP Inheritance

## What is in this SLU?

The main goal for this Learning Unit is to further develop your Python Class knowledge, studying the following topics:
- Parent and child classes;
- Simple (single) Inheritance;
- Multiple inheritance;
- Multilevel inheritance;
- Overriding;
- The `super()` function;
- The Method resolution order
- The `isinstance()` function ⚠️ (and the difference with `type()` function);

Keep in mind that this is only a fraction of the existing material on Python Object Oriented Programming. 
So, if you have the time, it is always important to keep on exploring this language. For sure you won't regret it. :)

Here is the link for the official Python documentation on classes (thus on inheritance), although with a more technical approach it has literally everything:
- https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#

## How to go through this SLU

1. Follow the [Weekly Workflow](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2025/blob/main/docs/weekly-workflow.md) to get the materials.
1. Study the Learning Notebook.
1. Read through the Exercise notebook guide to understand how Exercise notebooks work.
1. Solve the Exercise notebook and submit it as usual.

## I need help understanding something

You can and should ask for help, be it about learning notebooks, exercises, or anything else. Please checkout the [How to Ask for Help](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2025/blob/main/docs/slack.md), and remember not to share code when asking for help about the exercises!
