    "### 2.2.3 How does PIP handle dependencies?\n",
    "\n",
    "__Short answer:__ It doesn't. At least, not very well...\n",
    "\n",
    "__Long answer:__ PIP is the standard package manager that comes with Python. It allows you to install packages from PyPI and other indexes (repositories of Python packages). It also allows you to specify the version you *want* for the package. Keep in mind that what you *want* might not be what you *get*. \n",
    "\n",
    "PIP will go through your command or requirements file sequentially and install every package that you specified with a *naive* approach to version management. By *naive*, what we mean is that it will install exactly the version that you specify. However, if one of the packages has a subdependency on a package already installed, __it will overwrite the former's version unless it also satisfies the latter's requirements__!\n",
    "\n",
    "It will overwrite:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "> depX == 1.0.0\n",
    "> depY == 2.0.0  # but depY v2.0.0 depends on having depX v1.5.0 installed -> will overwrite with depX == v1.5.0\n",
    "``` \n",
    "It will not overwrite:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "> depX == 1.0.0\n",
    "> depZ == 2.0.0  # depZ v2.0.0 depends on having depX >= v1.0.0 -> will leave v1.0.0 installed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if the overwritten version is __incompatible__ with the rest of your project or dependencies? \n",
    "\n",
    "__Answer:__ Pip doesn't care; pip only installs. There is some leverage that package owners can enforce through certain dependency versions, but you should be careful nonetheless. "

    "### 2.3. Beyond PIP\n",
    "\n",
    "In a professional environment, you will most likely need to work with more powerful tools that are beyond the scope of this course. Tools like `poetry` `pdm`, and `pipenv` will create virtual environments, *resolve* dependencies, and lock exact versions. Such tools will ensure that your dependencies play nice with each other. (*bonus remark*: these tools also make building packages and publishing them much easier)\n",
    "\n",
    "And it won't stop there... if you delve into Python programming for long enough, you'll start to understand why it is necessary to use a particular tool, such as `pyenv`, to help manage Python versions during installations. Using these tools, your production-level projects might just stand the test of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least, as we said in a prior example, there are tools that you can install in your system using pip. Since these are typically not project-specific, but rather globally available in your system, make sure to find a better way to install these to avoid potential clashes. That is why there are tools such as `pipx`, which will handle the isolation of these types of packages behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are still early in your journey into Python programming and, as such, these are tools that you do not need right now. If you want to want to work in the industry, however, some of these are likely to show up.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Tip:__ Look into a couple of these tools before heading into technical interviews, as knowing about them and why you would need to use them can help you stand out from your competition. My suggestion would be to check out either `poetry` or `pdm` for dependency resolution and virtual environment handling and `pyenv` for managing different Python versions."
