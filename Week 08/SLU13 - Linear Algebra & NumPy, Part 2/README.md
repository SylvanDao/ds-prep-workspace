# SLU13 - Linear Algebra & NumPy, Part 2

In this unit you'll learn about matrix multiplication, determining the inverse, and how to use '**NumPy**' to perform those operations. You'll also learn about some '**NumPy**' methods which can be quite handy when you're summarizing and analyzing your data.

There are 2 optional sections, namely systems of linear equations and eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Although these are not required to pass the entrance exam, knowing about them is essential for virtually any data scientist.


# New concepts in this unit
- Matrix multiplication: understanding matrix multiplication, multiplication rules and application using '**NumPy**';
- The inverse of a Matrix: intuitions on the matrix inverse and application using '**NumPy**';
- Additional '**NumPy**' methods for the ndarray: min, max, sum and sort;
- Optional section - Systems of linear equations: Gauss-Jordan elimination and finding the inverse;
- Optional section - Eigenvalues and eigenvectors.


# New tools in this unit
Some of the functionalities of NumPy you'll learn about:
- [numpy.matmul()](https://numpy.org/doc/1.26/reference/generated/numpy.matmul.html)
- [numpy.linalg.inv()](https://numpy.org/doc/1.26/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.inv.html)
- [numpy.ndarray.max()](https://numpy.org/doc/1.26/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.max.html)
- [numpy.ndarray.min()](https://numpy.org/doc/1.26/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.min.html)
- [numpy.ndarray.sum()](https://numpy.org/doc/1.26/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.sum.html)
- [numpy.ndarray.sort()](https://numpy.org/doc/1.26/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.sort.html)

## How to go through this SLU?

1. Follow the [Learning Unit Workflow](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2025/blob/main/docs/weekly-workflow.md).
2. Go through the learning notebooks.
3. Do the exercise notebooks, and submit them, as usual.
4. [Optional] If you feel like learning a bit more, you can check the Extra Notebook.

## "I need help understanding something"

You can and should ask for help, whether it's regarding learning notebooks, exercises, or anything else. Please check out the [How to Ask for Help](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2025/blob/main/docs/slack.md), and remember **not to share code when asking for help about the exercises!**
